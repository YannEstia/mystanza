This test project is based on the use of Stanza and CoreNLP.


** Installation (source : https://stanfordnlp.github.io/stanza/installation_usage.html) **
__
** pip
Stanza supports Python 3.6 or later. We recommend that you install Stanza via pip, the Python package manager. To install, simply run:

pip install stanza

This should also help resolve all of the dependencies of Stanza, for instance PyTorch 1.3.0 or above.
If you currently have a previous version of stanza installed, use:
pip install stanza -U

__
** Anaconda

To install Stanza via Anaconda, use the following conda command:

conda install -c stanfordnlp stanza

Note that for now installing Stanza via Anaconda does not work for Python 3.8. For Python 3.8 please use pip installation.

__
** From Source

Alternatively, you can also install from source via Stanzaâ€™s git repository, which will give you more flexibility in developing on top of Stanza. For this option, run

git clone https://github.com/stanfordnlp/stanza.git
cd stanza
pip install -e .
